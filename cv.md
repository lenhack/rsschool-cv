## About myself:

I have dreamt of becoming a web developer for a long time. I started with learning Java on "Java Rush" and Python on "Stepik" in 2020. Being a bit disoriented about where to start, I took advice to learn QA before programming, so in 2021 I graduated from an Online University TOMMY as a QA. With this experience on my hands, I became reassured in my desire to be a developer. So, I made a final decision to study Front-End Development in RS School. I have graduated from Stage 0 successfully in February 2022. Unfortunately I had to stop learning because of war in Ukraine.  However I decided to continue learning. I can surely say that I enjoy doing various tasks, I love the feeling of satisfaction I get from a completed piece of work and wish to fulfill my dream of practicing web development.
